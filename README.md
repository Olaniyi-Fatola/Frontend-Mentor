## My process

### Built with

	This QR code webpage was built using just HTML and CSS on visual code.

### What I learned

While writing the HTML, I was lost on how to add the directories of the QR code image given and I later researched that, and now I know that, even though I later moved the image file to the code file.

```html
<img src="img/qrcode.png">
```

Through the CSS, I struggled with putting the QR components at the center of the page which I later had to research online for that.

```css
.box{
    margin: auto;
}
```

Thanks to Frontend Mentor for such a challenge, and I hope to improve my Frontend development skill.


### Continued development

I aim to focus more on reducing the CSS style as I know that in my code I have some jargon, which I don't really know which one it is and so I made some repetitions which I shouldn't have. Also, I hope to keep learning more about HTML and CSS so as to improve my web design skills for future projects.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://youtu.be/Q1uowGztXGs?si=9Bz5lTlW4N_HiczB) - This helped me while learning CSS. I really liked his teaching and I'll keep checking the videos whenever I get stuck in any project as he already explained most concepts in CSS in a detailed manner.
